              This is my digital garden where I add and refine notes as I continue learn. You'll notice that some notes are sparse where others are full blown articles. This is on purpose! As I continue to learn about a topic, I iterate and build on top of my notes.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              One of my favorite features about my garden is that my notes are organized in a graph structure. When a note is linked by other notes you'll be able to click into that other note to see how it is being referenced.
            </p>
            <p>
              The main categories I organize around are: <span class="font-bold">Design</span>, <span class="font-bold">Development</span>, <span class="font-bold">Business</span>, and <span class="font-bold">Health</span>. You can click through below and start exploring my notes.
