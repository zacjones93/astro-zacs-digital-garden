## Intro
This lecture is all about brown fat. We'll cover what brown fat is, how it functions, and how we can try to make more of it to improve our metabolism.

We'll talk about the different types of fat, specifically white, beige (also called brite) and brown fat. We'll discuss how they differ in function and morphology, and what induces the formation of each type of fat. We'll also cover the biology of the UCP1 protein and how it works in contrast to ATP synthase. 

Lastly, we'll discuss ways that we can induce the formation of brown fat through nutrition and lifestyle changes.

## Key take-aways
At the end of this lecture, you should be able to:

Name the three types of fat tissues
Know which type of fat has the most mitochondria
Know what cold temperature does to brown fat formation/activity
Understand the correlation between brown fat and markers of obesity and white fat
Understand how UCP1 works compared to ATP synthase
Know how the hypothalamus controls brown fat activity
Know the lifestyle factors that can influence the activity of brown fat

## Key terms
Key terms we will cover:

- Brown fat
- Beige fat
- UCP1
- ATP synthase
- Hypothalamus

- Most people think only of white adipose tissue when they hear the word “fat”, but there are in fact other types
- Brown fat/Beige fat is energetically more active than white fat
- We can control the activity of our brown fat through lifestyle choices

## Types of adipose tissue

white fat is all lipid droplet
beige has some mitochondria
brown fat has a lot of mitochondria

more brown fat in the winter

[[brown fat]] has significant inverse relations to [[BMI]]. total fat, and visceral fat

## What's purpose of [[brown fat]]?

- Despite high mitochondria content, brown adipocytes have a remarkably low capacity for ATP synthesis and express LOW levels of ATP synthase
- Instead they express a protein called UCP1 which induces the generation of HEAT, not ATP when hydrogen ions pass through its pore

### How do you turn it on
norepinephrine is signaled -> innervates brown fat
brown fat activates a lipolytic cascade, fuel electron transport chain

induces lipolysis in white fat as well

UCP1 is activated when free fatty acids are in a massive excess to ATP -- excessive food intake

## What is [[beige fat]]?

can form and unform from white fat.

mice didn't seem to get as obese when they had more beige fat

## impact on hormonal biology
- Forced expression of UCP1 in white fat improves leptin and insulin sensitivity
- Transplantation of brown fat into obese mice improves insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake in numerous tissues

## Induction of brown and beige fat
- cold exposure
  exposed to mild cold (66ºF) with light clothing for 2 hours
  repeated cold exposure over 6 weeks
- dietary interventions
fish oil

- endurance exercise

## Summary

- Brown and beige fat are important aspects of overall human metabolism
- Cold exposure is the most well studied and validated method to increase brown/beige fat formation & activation
- Dietary and exercise interventions also have the potential to increase brown & beige fat activity
- The overall capacity of these pathways to reduce body fat remains unknown
