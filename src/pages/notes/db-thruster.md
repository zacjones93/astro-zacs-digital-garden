- PoP
    - start by cleaning your dumbbells to the front rack
    - make sure your feet are shoulder width and toes pointed slightly out
    - you want the back head of the dumbbell to rest on your shoulders
    - drive your elbows upward and maintain that position the whole time
    - keep your chest up
    - just like the [[Air Squat]], initiate with hips going back and squat until your hips go bellow your knees
    - knees out the whole time
    - drive out of your squat and press the dumbbells overhead
    - important to make sure you don't press too early
