[ClojureFam](https://github.com/athensresearch/ClojureFam) is an open-source learning program for those who want to try out Clojure. 

The goal is for learners to learn enough Clojure to merge code into the [Athens codebase](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens).

I really love this model because it's a win for everyone involved. So far my experience has been super positive with the program.

When you sign up, you are assigned to a team. I'm in [[Team Phanes]] with several others.

We are working through [[Clojure from the Ground Up]] and [[Clojure for the Brave and True]].

I'm working through [4Clojure](http://www.4clojure.com/) problems and writing up solutions to some of those problems here: [[4Clojure]] 

I am #learninginpublic in [this twitter thread](https://twitter.com/zacjones93/status/1290411954037760002?s=20)
