## Cool down
- smash shoulders
- banded stretch on rig


## Movements
- [[inverted row]]
  - great exercise for upper back
  - this is done in the power rack
  - put the barbell in some J hooks
  - the higher the bar is, the easier it will be so we can find the right difficulty for you
  - IMPORTANT: you want to always be inside the rack so you pull against the bar
  - heels touching the ground
  - pronated or supinated, both work great
  - grip width is up to you, id recommend just outside shoulders
  - aim to touch right where you would with a bench press, lower chest
  - elbows in line with the middle of your body
  - scaling
    - feet flat with knees bent
