Text style definitions mean that you don't just throw around treatment of text without reason throughout your application.

What are you implying with the font weight of your text?
What are you implying with the text size?

Consistency is key with these definitions so others can pick up on the pattern. In any given application you shouldn't have more than 4 font sizes. Any more and you look sloppy. 

Don't worry about these definitions until you're a few screens into your designs. Notice the patterns that you are building in and abstract them out and make them consistent throughout your application.
