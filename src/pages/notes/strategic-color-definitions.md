Every color you use should have a reason behind it. You can have colors for doing something as well as colors for going somewhere.

Usually your app will have a single distinct, full saturation color for a primary [[call to action]] as well as a lower contrast color for a secondary [[call to action]].

These colors can be brand colors or not and might compliment each other.

In addition to your CTA colors, there should be [[structural colors]] that are more neutral and build the basis for your application. In many user content generated sites structural colors are off-white or light grey as a lot of color comes through the content that the user adds to the site.
