When you design UI, you build a hierarchy on each page letting the user know what's most important. You use hierarchy to let your users know you want them to keep scrolling, perform an action, or browse a list.

There are a number of tools at your disposal to create hierarchy on a page. You can do so with your [[typography]] via [[text style definitions]], the [[negative space]] and general spacing that you give elements or text, as well as the [[color]] you use via [[strategic color definitions]].
