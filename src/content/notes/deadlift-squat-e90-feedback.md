Consider the context that the class is going to be in. We won't have time to cover every PoP that there is in super detail, pick one that you'd like to focus on and make it stick.

For each piece of the workout, you should be estimating the time it will take to work through it so you can optimize the hour. "Warm up will take 8 minutes, that leaves X minutes for Strength, X minutes for transition, and X minutes for the metcon for the day."

Project louder!

Think about logistics, this Strength piece has 2 barbells so instructing everyone to find a partner of similar strength and claim another barbell would be the right thing to do.
