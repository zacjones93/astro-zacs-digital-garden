title: Dumbbell Lunge
tags: CrossFit
---


- lunge forward keeping your torso upright and your core engaged
- for a strong lunge position you want your front leg to make a 90ยบ angle at the knee with your shin verticle
  - if your knee is too far over your toes it will put extra stress on it
- dumbbells stay static by your side, no swinging them!
- shoulders stay engaged by being pulled back and down
- step back
