HSB stands for hue, saturation, brightness.

Hue is the 0-360 scale of a color wheel that you would typically find.

Saturation is the amount of white present. e.g. 0 saturation is totally white, 100 saturation is totally the color hue that you chose.

Brightness is the amount of black in the color. 100 will make any hue completely black.
