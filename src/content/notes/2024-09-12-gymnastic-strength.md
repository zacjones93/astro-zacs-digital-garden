[[BCF class prep]]

50 pull ups
50 dips
50 toes to bar
## Brief (5:20-5:25)
We got a gymnastics strength day

Today we have a chipper where you'll work through each movement of 50 reps before moving to the rest. This is alot of work to put in on each of the movements so this isn't really 'for time' in the traditional sense that we are spiking our heart rate in a metcon.

Very straight forward - 50 pull ups, 50 dips, 50 toes to bar

We want to see as much strict movement as possible so strict pull ups, dips and toes to bar.

Before scaling to a kip, shoot for a number to accumulate strict.

For scaling there are a few ways we could do this. 

- 5 rounds of 10 could be a decent scale if you have the volume but will get stuck
- Just less reps, say 30-30-30

for movements
- lever bar pull ups
- parallel bar/matador, banded dips, push ups
- kipping toes to bar, knee raises

## Warm up (5:25-5:35)
