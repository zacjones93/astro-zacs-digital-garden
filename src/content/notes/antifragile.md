title: antifragile
---

The book describes three states that are on a spectrum: fragile, robust, and antifragile. 

Fragile is anything that breaks from randomness and stressors. It is the tourist that wants the whole vacation mapped out so that their experiences are predictable (vs. the adventurer that welcomes the problems that arise and thrives in the unknown). Fragility needs to control what is going to happen or it won't survive. The problem arises in that it is impossible to know what will happen. You can try to predict events but there will always be events that are unpredictable (Black Swan events) which throw your plan off.

The unpredictability, and therefore risk, make being fragile a precarious position to find yourself in.

Often times when people think of the opposite of fragile they think of robust or resilient. This isn't quite true but it's headed in the right direction. Robust certainly handles more random events than fragile but the key here is that a robust system does not improve from the stress of random events that occur. 

Antifragile is anything that grows from disorder. It loves to have it's systems stressed and welcomes randomness (which is needed) so that it can grow.

Becoming antifragile means you love mistakes, you want to make them often and correct for them as much as possible. The more mistakes you make, the more you know that you are now on the right path to success. Those that don't make mistakes might be heading for a large correction.

> We can simplify the relationships between fragility, errors, and antifragility as follows. When you are fragile, you depend on things following the exact planned course, with as little deviation as possible --for deviations are more harmful than helpful. This is why fragile _needs_ to be very predictive in its approach, and, conversely, predictive systems cause fragility. When you want deviations, and you don't care about the possible dispersion of outcomes that the future can bring, since most will be helpful, you are antifragile.

A great analogy for this spectrum is comparing three Greek mythologies: Sword of Damocles (fragile), Phoenix (robust), and Hydra (antifragile). 

The Damocles is a character in Greek Mythology that enjoys the luxuries of a great feast. From the outside it looks like he has everything under control and a good life. This is until you find out that there is a sword hanging above him restrained only by a hair from a horse tail. It will drop at some point. This single event will change the entire story, when the sword drops Damocles will die making him Fragile.

The Phoenix is different in that it lives it's life but when it dies, it rises out of it's ashes anew again. This makes it robust in that it handles stressors and random events that come at it but it does not improve over time.

The Hydra is a mythological beast that has many heads. When you chop off on of it's heads, two replace it. This proves to be antifragile in that it's in the hydras best interest to find conflict so that it can become stronger.

Other areas on this spectrum (fragile, robust, antifragile) are worth pondering:

- **Regulation**: Rules, Principles, Virtue
- **Errors**: Hates mistakes, Mistakes are information, Loves mistakes
- **Financial dependence**: corporate employment, niche worker/minimum-wage earner, taxi driver/artisan/f*** you money

## Antifragile in Systems

An Antifragile system prefers the individual units in the system to be fragile. This means that individuals within the system can fail but them failing improves the system as a whole. The others in that system learn from the failures of the the fragile. This means theres a small volatility within the system due to random events but the system will remain in tact and even improve over time. 

Contrast this to a top-down approach to systems where the volatility of the individual is removed and 'handled' by the system itself. This feels great for the individuals in that system until a big enough random event comes along and destroys the system as a whole. Which shows in the end that there was more risk involved even though individual volatility was lower.

## Quotes that I like

> With few exceptions, those who dress outrageously are robust or even antifragile in reputation; those clean-shaven types who dress in suits and ties are fragile to information about them. --pg. 52

> Much of modern life is preventable chronic stress injury. --pg. 64

> Black Swan Management 101: nature (and nature-like systems) likes diversity between organisms rather than diversity within an immortal organism. --pg. 68

> ...We saw that the restaurant business is wonderfully efficient precisely because restaurants, being vulnerable, go bankrupt every minute, and entrepreneurs ignore such a possibility, as they think that they will beat the odds. In other words, some class of rash, even suicidal, risk taking is healthy for the economy--under the condition that not all people take the same risks and that these risks remain small and localized.
> Now, by disrupting the model, as we will see, with bailouts, governments typically favor a certain class of firms that are large enough to require being saved in order to avoid contagion to other business. This is the opposite of healthy risk-taking; it is transferring fragility from the unfit to the collective. --pg. 75

> "What does not kill me makes me stronger"...could as well mean "what did not kill me did not make me stronger, but spared me because I am stronger than others; but it killed others and the average population is now stronger because the weak are gone" --pg. 76
