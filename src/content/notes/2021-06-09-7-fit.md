## Feedback from [[Tucker Jones]]

Overviews and breakdown of the movements in each piece was good.
Good movement through class.
finding the larger faults.
good mobility finisher.

### Areas to improve

#### Technical
Use every moment for improvement.
Go over movement, then have them do it so they don't forget what it is right away.
And this way you can correct them immediately
Keep class together doing the same movement at the same time to correct form and get everyone on the same page.

Think about the flow of class. "go grab a dumbbell and a band"

If there is a technical movement, do a full review and break it down to have people moving through the pieces. For this class, I should have done a review of the dB push press. Foot position, dip / drive, etc.

#### Emotional

Make sure everyone knows each other.
If someone is new, introduce them to the class and get everyone to share their name.

Bring more energy. You have good energy and that will transfer to the athletes.
Get them pumped up, they should want to be there.
