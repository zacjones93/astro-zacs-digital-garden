Annie
50-40-30-20-10 Reps For Time
Double-Unders
Sit-Ups

## Brief 5:20-5:25

We have two pieces for today. First a tempo deadlift session followed by Annie. 

(30X2) 
Whenever you see this annotation, it means we have some tempo/pause work. First number is duration of the eccentric (lowering) portion of the movement. Second number is at the bottom, the duration of the concentric (pressing/active) portion of the movement and finally the last number is duration of the pause at the top. 

So for (30X2) we're doing 3 seconds eccentric, no rest at the bottom, explode up, 2 second pause at the top. With a deadlift we essentially start at the `X` and work from there which can make the annotation confusing.

Annie is a classic benchmark in crossfit. If you have double unders, but not as many as prescribed you can back off and do less reps or work for a fixed amount of time.

We should all be able to do sit ups.
