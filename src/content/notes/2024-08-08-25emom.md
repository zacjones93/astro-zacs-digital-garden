[[BCF class prep]]

## Brief 

We got a nice long Emom for today which is every minute on the minute we’re doing one of these stations. So once you finish your set amount of work you’ll rest until the next minute to start your next set 
We’ll start with 25 walking lunges
Then move to 15 push ups
The a :30 wall sit
And finishing with :20 support on rings. This means hop up in a locked out position and hold

What is like to see for each station is for you to challenge yourself with the movement. If regular walking lunges is going to be too easy let’s add some weight. Maybe it’s overhead with a db, front rack or farmer carry

Same with each other station, maybe we add a deficit to our push ups or a plate to the wall sit 

## Warm up

3 rds
10/8 cals on bike
5 Inch worm w/ a push up
10 worlds greatest stretch
10 air squats
