Just like the [[Deadlift]]
- [demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNpUNRPQkAk&ab_channel=CrossFit%C2%AE)
- start in a standing position with dumbbells in each hand
- feet hip-width apart
- shoulders slightly in front of dumbbells at start
- dumbbells will start and end right outside of your feet
- dumbbells remain over the middle of your foot during the movement
- flex the knee a little without it being locked out
- keep your core engaged, super important
- deadlift is initiated with your hips sent back on the way down
