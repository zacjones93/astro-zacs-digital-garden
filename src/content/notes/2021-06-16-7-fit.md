Coaching skills that I'm focusing on:
- **If there is a technical movement, do a full review and break it down**
- **Get athletes pumped up, they should want to be there**
- **Take every opportunity to coach movement**

## Links for movements

- [[Dumbbell Deadlift]]
  - [demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNpUNRPQkAk&ab_channel=CrossFit%C2%AE)
  - start in a standing position with dumbbells in each hand
  - feet hip-width apart
  - shoulders slightly in front of dumbbells at start
  - dumbbells will start and end right outside of your feet
  - dumbbells remain over the middle of your foot during the movement
  - flex the knee a little without it being locked out
  - keep your core engaged, super important
  - deadlift is initiated with your hips sent back on the way down
- [[Dumbbell Lunge]]
  - lunge forward keeping your torso upright and your core engaged
  - for a strong lunge position you want your front leg to make a 90ยบ angle at the knee with your shin verticle
    - if your knee is too far over your toes it will put extra stress on it
  - dumbbells stay static by your side, no swinging them!
  - shoulders stay engaged by being pulled back and down
  - step back


- [[Banded Hip Hinge]]
  - [demo of the hip hinge variation we are doing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=-2AGIruhpsM&ab_channel=TheBarbellPhysio)
  - [good cues and points of performance](http://fullscalefit.com/new/product/banded-hip-hinge/)
  - Driving through your heels
  - consciously activate the gluteus maximus (butt), stand up and squeeze.
  - Lower yourself back to the hinge by using a controlled and slow movement.
  - focus on using the glutes and hamstrings by driving from the heel
  - if your back is feeling worked you are doing these wrong!
  - keep shoulders back and engaged
  - core tight
- [[Medicine Ball Hamstring Curls]]
  - [demo and points of performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=R_INXCfwVLY&ab_channel=InvictusFitness)
