## Intro
In this lecture, we'll talk about the connection between the immune system and our metabolism. We'll discuss how inflammation can change how fat cells, or adipocytes, function at a cellular level AND how those adipocytes can contribute to the inflammatory process in a feed-back loop.

We will talk about how exercise in particular is the path forward to breaking this vicious feed-back loop. Gut health will also be a topic of discussion as much of the inflammatory processes in the body often tie back to the gut.

## key take aways
At the end of this lecture, you should be able to:

Name the types of immune cells in non-obese fat
Name the types of immune cells in obese-fat

  

Describe the ways in which adipocytes change as the get larger due to increased fatty-acid deposition
Describe how exercise can improve metabolic inflammation (there are 5)
Understand (at a high level) the connection between the gut, the immune system and fat tissue


## Key terms

Inflammation
Leaky gut
Th2 T cell
Treg T cell
M2 macrophage
Th1 T cell
CD8 T cell
M1 macrophage
Adipocyte
Oxidative stress
LPS

## what is inflammation

hosts response to a perceived pathogenic invasion

inflammation is robust but short-term

Chronic inflammation is different. lower inflammation but constant

chronic viral infections - hiv, 
leaky gut
stress - produces cortisol which suppresses immune responses

## Obesity and inflammation
obese have 2-3x higher levels of inflammatory markers
  CVD. T2D, Several cancers, depression, inactivity

research has shown that adipose tissue isn't just responding inflammation but generating it

### How do adipocytes change??

as adipocytes get larger, oxygen can't get to some of the tissue
mitochondrial damage
insulin signaling is messed with- resistance increased
eventual death of the adipocyte

### inflammation also changes activity levels
decreased physical activity is directly caused by inflammation

activity also reduces inflammation
- Improved insulin sensitivity
- Decreased de novo lipid generation
- Decreased endoplasmic reticulum stress
- Switching from M1 to M2 macrophage phenotype 
- “Browning” of fat tissue

## Could leaky gut be an inflammatory trigger?
yes.

LPS, and lower gut barrier

##  diet increases inflammation, inflammation drives obesity

- Inflammation changes the biology of adipose tissue 
  - Decreased insulin sensitivity
  - Decreased oxygen delivery
  - Increased mitochondrial damage
- Adipose tissue exacerbates inflammation by producing inflammatory molecules
- Focus on gut health, liver health, stress reduction and most importantly, exercise to break this cycle
- Anti-inflammatory supplements may provide benefit (Omega-3 signaling being reasonably well studied)

high fiber
focus on liver health -- science based liver detox
reduce stress
exercise
