[[BCF class prep]]

BCF  shoulder to overhead heavy day

Clean + push press + push jerk + split jerk


## Brief

Today we have 10 sets of a shoulder to overhead complex that starts with a clean. When you get the bar to your shoulders you’ll do a push press, re rack into a push jerk and finally rerack for a split jerk

Well build in weight through each set, working up to something heavy.

The clean can be squat or power but I recommend power if you’ve been coming this week

The crux of this complex is how much you can push press which means push jerk and split jerk should be manageable. This is a great time to work on your push and split jerk technique under a little fatigue after the heavy push press

## Warm up
