This lecture will review all the ways in which fats/fatty acids are taken in, stored, and metabolized within the human body.

We will start off with a review of the different structures that various fats come in, from fatty acids, cholesterol, phospholipids, etc.  We will review what makes a fat "saturated versus "unsaturated."

We follow that with an overview of the digestion and absorption of fats. We will explore the organs and enzymes involved in that process, notably the liver and gall bladder for bile production. We talk about what happens to fats once they enter the body, how they are transported to adipose tissue or metabolized.

We will talk about specific processes related to the anabolism and catabolism of fats, including:

  - The conversion of carbs into fats
  - The mobilization of fatty acids from adipose tissue
  - How fatty acids are converted into acetyl-CoA and eventually ATP
  - The production and use of ketone bodies
  - Cholesterol metabolism
  - Phospholipid biology
  - Omega 3/6 signaling

## Key Takeaways

## Lipid Structure

  Lipids come in more diversity.

  Saturated fatty acids are acids that only have single bonds
  unsaturated fatty acids have a double bond in the structure somewhere. This creates a kink which makes this lipid less densely packed than saturated

  Triglyceride is a backbone that can link un/saturated fatty acids

  Steroids and Cholesterol is still considered lipids

## Lipid Digestion and Absorption

### [[liver]] and [[gallbladder]]
- The liver is responsible for a large number of functions, but specific to digestion its responsible for the production of bile
- [[Bile]] is then sent to the gallbladder for storage -- which extracts water out of Bile to make it more concentrated
- [[Bile]] is partially responsible for the digestion of fats to fatty acids

### Fat Digestion
- The majority of dietary fat comes in the form of triacylglycerol, along with some cholesterol and small amounts of phospholipids
- Fat soluble vitamins are also absorbed as well (such as vitamin A)
- Digestion of fat necessitates that the lipid molecules are accessible by enzymes, which requires a step called emulsification

Bile salts take a big fat globule and break them down into much smaller pieces... [[Emulsification]]

- A small amount of fat digestion of fat occurs in the stomach, by gastric lipase
- However, most of the digestive process occurs in the small intestine, due to the production of pancreatic lipase
- For [[lipase]] to access fat, emulsification must occur
  - Bile salts, produced by the liver and concentrated by the gall bladder are
released into the small intestine
  - Bile salts stabilize the hydrophobic aspects of the lipids, allowing for smaller and smaller ‚Äúdroplets‚Äù to be formed
  - As they become smaller, pancreatic lipase is able to access the triacylglycerols and begin hydrolysis to form free fatty acids

the lipids get packaged up as Chylomicrons in the [[epithelial]] cell layer. They enter the [[Lacteal]] which get transported into the lymph system

### Fat Absorption and Transport
- Transporters bring micelles through the membrane into the GI epithelial cells
- Once inside, fatty acids reform triacylglycerol, are packaged with cholesterol, phospholipids and ApoB, and shipped out into the lacteal as ‚ÄúChylomicrons‚Äù
- Chylomicrons pass into the lymphatic system, eventually reaching the circulatory system, where they are slowly broken down by adipose tissue, leaving only a cholesterol dense particle that is removed by the liver

### Fatty Acid Uptake by Adipocytes
- Adipose tissue produces an enzyme called [[lipoprotein lipase]] (LPL), which is secreted and then bound to the surface of blood vessels
- LPL slowly breaks down the chylomicrons into smaller sizes, liberating fatty acids for uptake into the adipocytes
- Fatty acids reform triacylglycerides in the adipocytes

The body transforms single fatty acids to triacylglycerides and back when it needs to go in and out of cells

## [[Lipogenesis]]
So you ate a tooonnn of carbs..
- The process of creating long chain fatty acids for long term storage of energy
- Stimulated by high levels of citrate
- End process of lipogenesis is a triacylglycerol called ‚Äú[[Palmitate]]‚Äù or sometimes ‚ÄúPalmitic Acid‚Äù
- Requires a good amount of [[ATP]] and [[NADH]]
- [[Biotin]] dependent process

High concentrations of [[Acetyl-CoA]]. First signal that storing food.

- The process of lipogenesis begins with acetyl-CoA... but it has to occur in the cytosol of the cell
- Acetyl-CoA cannot move outside of the mitochondria so the acetyl-CoA ‚Äúhides‚Äù within citrate which CAN leave the mitochondria
- Citrate is broken down into Oxaloacetate and acetyl-CoA
- Acetyl-CoA (2C) converts to Malonyl- CoA (3C)
- Oxaloacetate forms pyruvate
  - Which in turn cycles back into the mitochondria to get stored as acetyl-CoA

- Lipogenesis begins with malonyl-CoA being reduced to [[butyrate]], a SHORT chain fatty acid
- This process repeats itself 6 more times to make a long chain fatty acid called [[palmitate]]
  - Will repeat this three times until all three docking stations 
- Palmitate can be modified or desaturated to form other fatty acids

- The liver is the primary location for lipogenesis, however adipose tissue can run this process as well
- The triglycerides are sent out from the liver and taken up by adipose tissue and skeletal muscle

### Summary of Lipid Biology in an Energy Rich State
- Fatty acids are absorbed from the GI tract and packaged as chylomicrons
- Chylomicrons travel to the adipose tissue, where it is broken down by LPL and taken into the adipocyte
->  Long-term storage of fats as TAG
- Excess glucose can be converted into fatty acids through lipogenesis
- Triglycerides are transported as lipoproteins to the adipose tissue
->  Long-term storage of fats as TAG

## Lipolysis
- The breakdown of triglycerides stored in adipocytes
- Stimulated by the presence of glucagon (‚ÄúGlucose-Gone‚Äù) and/or epinephrine
- Enzymes turn a TAG into a DAG, which gets turned into a MAG, which is finally turned into glycerol
  - Adipose triglyceride lipase 
  - Hormone sensitive lipase 
  - Monoacylglycerol lipase
- Insulin inhibits this full pathway
  - What does this mean for insulin resistance???

**The body doesn't waste anything**

Fatty acids can be pulled into muscle and used
if theres a lot of fatty acids and low glucose the muscle will use the fatty acids.

## How are Fatty Acids processed into energy
- First an acyl-CoA group is added to ‚Äúactivate‚Äù the fatty acid
- Requires ATP

Fatty acids can't get through mitochondria membrane

- Next, a complex series of reactions occurs to essentially move the fatty acyl-CoA inside the mitochondria
- Called the ‚ÄúCarnitine Shuttle‚Äù
- Finally, a process called Beta Oxidation occurs, removing 2 carbons from the end of the fatty acid at a time
- Produces Acetyl-CoA, which enters into the TCA, leading to ATP generation

to use fatty acids as fuel, you need [[carnitine]]!
### Signs of carnitine deficiency
- Decreased or floppy muscle tone or muscle weakness
- Tiredness (fatigue)
- Irritability
- Delayed movement (motor) development
- Poor feeding in a baby
- Symptoms of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) if the liver is affected
- Swelling (edema) or shortness of breath, if the heart is affected

Waking up hungry in the night.

## Beta-Oxidation
Try to pull two carbons off a fatty acid. Cleave the beta-carbon
will happen 7 times
- Long chain fatty acids are ‚Äúattacked‚Äù at the 2nd C position
- End product is acetyl-CoA, NADH, FADH2
- A 16 carbon fatty acid can make 8 acetyl-CoA,
7 NADH and 7 FADH2

## Once again.. [[Citric Acid Cycle]]
- One cycle of this pathway results results in 3 NADH and 1 FADH2 molecules
- These molecules are essentially carriers of potential energy in the form of electrons
- They will ‚Äúdonate‚Äù these electrons in the next step, called the electron transport chain

One molecule of glucose produces 38 ATP
One 16C fatty acid produces 129 ATP!!!


## Ketogenesis
- Ketones are mainly produced by the liver, in the mitochondria
- The process is considered to be glucose ‚Äúsparing‚Äù
- Two molecules of acetyl-CoA combine to produce acetoacetyl-CoA
- A third acetyl-CoA is added to produce HMG-CoA
- HMG-CoA drops two carbons to form Acetoacetate
- Acetoacetate can be further converted to ùû´-hydroxybutyrate
- Acetone is expelled from the lungs as a gas
### ketolysis
- Almost the exact same reaction as ketosis in reverse
- Ketones are converted BACK into acetyl-CoA and used in the TCA

## [[Cholesterol metabolism]]
- Synthesized in just about every cell of the body
  - Kidney makes the dominant amount
  - Very little dietary cholesterol is involved in serum cholesterol
- Cholesterol circulates in the blood as a lipoprotein - bound to protein to become soluble
- Cholesterol is the precursor molecule for ALL steroid hormones
  - As such, the adrenal glands make a lot as well
  - People with genetically low levels of blood cholesterol still have normal hormone levels
- Plays a critical role in bile acid generation 
- Necessary for Vitamin D production
- Finally, critical for cell membrane biology

### Formation of Cholesterol
- Very similar process to the formation of ketones, but occurs in the cytosol
- The cytosol has a unique enzyme from the mitochondria, called HMG-CoA reductase that pushes the pathway towards cholesterol
- Requires NADPH from the pentose phosphate pathway
- T3, Insulin & high ATP levels stimulate this pathway
- Cortisol (stress) and glucagon (low levels of glucose) inhibit

## Phospholipids
- Two fatty acids attached to a 3 carbon glycerol backbone with a ‚Äúphosphodiester bridge‚Äù
  - Most phospholipids have one saturated and on unsaturated fatty acid each
- Phospholipids are characterized by the additions to these fatty acids
  - Phosphatidylserine
  - Phosphatidylethanolamine 
  - Phosphatidylcholine
  - Phosphatidylinositol
  - phosphatidylglycerols
- **Used to wrap all cells in the entire body**
- **Involved in surfactants which are critical for lung function**
- Used in bile production as well, for detoxification

## [[Eicosanoids]]
- Otherwise known as Omega-6 and Omega-3 fatty acids
- Derived from what we call ‚Äúessential fatty acids‚Äù (linoleic acid and alpha linoleic acid)
- Omega-6 can be processed to produce arachidonic acid, a pro-inflammatory molecule involved in innate immunity
- Omega-3 can be processed to produce EPA and DHA, generally anti-inflammatory molecules

People are starting to say they are bad.. we typically have more Omega-6 in our diet which throws off the balance to Omega-3. The balance is important

- Alpha linoleic acid is processed downstream to produce EPA and DHA
  - anti-inflammatory
- Linoleic acid is processed downstream to process arachidonic acid
- Further processed to produce an array of inflammatory molecules
### Omega-3 Mechanisms of Action
- EPA and DHA signal through several membrane receptors to modulate pathways of inflammation and fibrosis

## Dietary Fat

Stored fat can do Beta oxidation (produce acetyl-CoA) and Generate phospholipids but not produce omega-3/6 (you need them from diet!)

## Summary
- Lipids come in a diverse array of structures
- Fats are digested by the combined action of bile and lipase enzymes
- In energy rich states, dietary fats are stored as TAGs in adipose tissue
- In energy poor states, dietary fats are used as an energy AND lipolysis occurs in adipose tissue, liberating fatty acids for energy use in the body
- Fatty acids are broken down into Acetyl-CoA through a process called Beta-Oxidation
- Ketones are created through the merging of 3 Acetyl-CoA molecules - Cholesterol is created from a very similar pathway
- Phospholipids are similar to triglycerides, except they have replaced one fatty acid with a hydrophilic phosphodiester group
- Omega-3 and 6 eicosanoids come almost exclusively from our diet and modify the inflammatory pathway
