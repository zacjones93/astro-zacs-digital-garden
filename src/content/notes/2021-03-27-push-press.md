Evaluator: [[Tucker Jones]]

Movement: [[Push Press]]

## Areas of Excellence
- Good progression (using [[Push Press Progression]])
- Good movement through athletes
- Good time management

## Areas for Improvement

- demo - feet wide + low back arched
- don't say "you can drop the barbells"
- have athletes wrap all fingers around barbell (if possible)
- position where you can see more athletes 
  - around perimeter vs in the middle
- Stay and watch athletes after cue
- keep working to fix fault
  - mix up variety of cues

## Thoughts for improvement

Have you tried all the types of cue - verbal, visual, tactile?

Identify common faults for the movement and prepare different cues for that movement.

e.g. Athlete dips too low and doesn't 'get it' when you say use a 2" dip.

-> cue through showing them what they are doing and how you'd correct it

-> "dip until your bar hits my hand"
