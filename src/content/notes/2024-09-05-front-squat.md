Front Squat -(2x4)-(2x4)-(2x4)-(2x4)

## Brief
We got a heavy day today building across 8 sets of front squats. I’m going to give y’all about 30 minutes to do this which means you’ll need to hit a set about every 3-4 minutes. That’s a lot of rest, highly recommend getting a bench out and sitting down between sets

We’re looking to start at a moderate weight and build over these 8 sets where each weight you’ll hit two sets then increase
