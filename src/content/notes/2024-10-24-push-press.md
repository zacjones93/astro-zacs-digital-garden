## Brief

We're on a de-load week which means we're backing off percentages for our lifting. I repeat, we are backing off percentages so don't be maxing this pushpress out 

to get our intensity for today, we're adding a little extra work to the end of each set of push press.

a row sprint followed by 8-12 strict dips. These row sprints are timed so you'll want to get a whiteboard out and log your time after each sprint.

when you're done with your row, head over to the rig for you dips

rest as needed between sets.
