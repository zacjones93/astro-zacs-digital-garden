Knowledge Adventure clubs are groups of people that meet on a regular basis to work through content together. They are based on the [[Knowledge Hydrant]] model.

The main purpose and benefit is to share key take aways and enthusiasm with others in the group. Seeing and hearing how another person is learning the same material can be encouraging to you as understandings solidify and knowledge is uncovered.

The format is very flexible and can be shaped to the content that is being learned. The output can be formal or informal, it's up to the group and any external purpose for holding the adventure.

The discussion that results from the material that is covered each week often turns out to be a great asset to have if you have access to recording.
