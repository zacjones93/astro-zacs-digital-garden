[[BCF class prep]]

## Brief 
5:20-5:25

We have a some intervals for our workout today. This is a nice long interval of 10 minutes where we’ll do this work then rest until the end of that 10 minute window to repeat the interval 2 more times
This means ideally we will be getting our work done in 8 minutes or less to give some time to reset and recover before the next interval. 
Each interval includes

1000m row
20 ring dips
20 box jumps

**Row**
We should all be somewhat familiar with our row paces but if you were to row 2:00 pace, this 1000 meters will take you 4:00 minutes. Something a little slower than your 2k pace would work great here. Fast rows will be closer to 3:30 but let’s try and keep our row under 5 minutes. 
That means you have roughly 4:00 to get the rest of this work done to include proper rest 

**Ring dip**
This will be the most taxing movement or what can eat up a lot of your time when you get tired. Well want to pick a scale where we can maintain sets of 5-10 through out 
- banded
- Matador 
- Parallel bars
- Box dips
- Push ups
**Box jump**
This box jump is high. We don’t normally do 32/27 inches so you’ll need to stay focused on each rep and get explosive. If this is too high we’ll find a height that works for you (that’s challenging) as we warm up
