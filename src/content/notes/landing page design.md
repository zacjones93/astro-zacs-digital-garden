## Header Section 


### Tips
  - don't use colors on the outer edges of the color wheel, too intense generally
  - H1 should be big and bold, bump that font up a bit
  - Header image should take up the full width of the screen
  - serif better for body text
    - more readable, even though sans serif has trended as body text for a while
  - try to only use 2 fonts
  - no nav bar
  - 12 column grid


## session two

- structure should stay the same
- what's more important, what's less important


- use more pictures, less pictures
- full width

- four things you can do with text
  - font size
  - font weight
  - font color
  - line height
