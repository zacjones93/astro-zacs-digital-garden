## Brief 5:20-5:25
Today we have a longer strength-style workout that's kind of for time. In other words, we want you moving through these movements steadily without getting hung up on an particular one but want you to challenge yourself on the strongman piece enough to where you need to slow down to do it right

## Warm up 5:25-35

50 single unders
15 shoulder taps
static hold - handstand/hang


## Strongman movement warm up 5:35-5:45
Try a few movements and figure out which ones you are doing for today. warm those up to a solid/challenging workout weight
