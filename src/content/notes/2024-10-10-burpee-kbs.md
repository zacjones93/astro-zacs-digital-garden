## Brief 4:15-4:20

Today we got 2 pieces, turkish get ups and finishing with a little burner of kettlebell swings and burpees.

Turkish get up is one of the more odd weightlifting movements we do. Essentially, can you get off the ground holding weight in your hand. These are great for mobility and finding stability in positions we don't get in often.

There isn't much to say about the workout, find a pace you can maintain and get at it. I would hold a slower pace on burpees for the first two rounds then build in pace from there. Going unbroken on the swings is a great goal but looking for 1-3 sets per round.
