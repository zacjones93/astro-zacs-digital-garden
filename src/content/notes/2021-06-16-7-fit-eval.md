Class: [[7 Fit]]
Evaluator: [[Tucker Jones]]

## Take aways
- communicating the literal points of performance is less important
- **Find the primary action and relate that** to athletes in a way they can understand
  - wall balls - instead of saying extend your hips to extension.. EXPLODE through the top to finish the rep
- Find ways to cue poor movement of an athlete without getting stuck on them (and leaving everyone else waiting)
  - Give them a cue and take a mental note to return
  - if helpful for everyone, give a cue to individual athlete and then get attention of everyone and go through the cue in a little more detail
- Athletes that are convinced they can’t do something
  - take them aside after class and work with them to show them how they can make progress
  - e.g. can’t touch knee to ground
- Think about the physical space of the workout.
  - Will there be enough room with what the CrossFit class is doing?
  - How many people are you expecting?
## Warm up
  - Active coaching w/ lot’s of cues
  - Always start with foot position with any movement
  - PROJECT LOUDER
  - Stuck on one athlete
## Strength
  - demo and movement walk through took much longer than expected with 10 athletes
  - good demo
  - good job organizing class in lanes
  - finding faults (some of the time).. good on DL
  - good movement around class
  - PROJECT MORE
  - Do 10 reps instead of 5
  - Demand more of each movement
    - don’t let people get away with 90% effort (hips sagging a little on glute bridge)
## Metcon
  - encouraging
  - good movement around class
  - good scaling help w/ med ball
  - Didn’t demo all the movements! (burpee)
  - demo first then talk technique
  - clock management
    - make sure you count up on a ‘for time’ workout
  - Run 2nd fan
