[[BCF class prep]]

5rds
30/25 cal row
20 ttb
10 frontsquats 185/125

## Brief
We got a nice loooong metcon today. If you want to get nerdy with it, we call this a MWG triplet.

Expect to be working about 25-30 minutes on this one but we'll be setting a 30 minute time cap. If were going over the cap then something held us up a little too much for what we want today

30/25 cals on the row should take about 90 seconds (if you're cooking) to 2 minutes depending who you are. Be intentional with your pace here, set a pace in rounds 1 and 2 and try to hold that for 3/4/5

20 ttb is a pretty hefty set so I recommend breaking these up early and often. For people confident with ttb maybe 2-3 sets, for most of us this is going to be 3-5 sets. Lets start scaling if you know you're going to break down into singles after a round or two.

The frontsquat should be heavy but manageable. Think 1-2 sets the whole time.

## Warm up
3 rds
