We got along intervals for todays workout with 2 minutes of work and 1 minute of rest. With that rest built in that means you should be going pretty hard but at a maintainable pace as we got 36 minutes or 6 rounds of work

The Buy in for each round should take 1:00-1:30 depending on how fast your moving but you want atleast 30 seconds to accumulate reps for your score, ideally :45.
