Thoughts and reflections on how this went: [[Deadlift Squat E90 feedback]]

```
Every 1:30 for 4 Rounds
(1): 10 Deadlifts  (50-55%)
(2): 10 BackSquats (50-55%)
```
## Intro
- Today is leg day!
- We're looking at high volume [[Deadlift]]s and [[Back Squat]]s today.
- This will be an [[EMOM]] style format where you will have 1 minute and 30 seconds to complete the movement you're on. 
- We'll be doing 4 rounds (of both Deadlift and Backsquat)
- We want the weight for both bars to stay the same though if you want to make an adjustment after the first round that will work.
- Also! Deadlifts are no longer dead stop. You can go touch-and-go with them as this is a lot of work
- We'll work through a deadlift progression to get ya'll warmed up for the movement and then do a review of backsquat after with a set of 10 before you start loading your bars
## Points of Performance
### [[Deadlift]]
- In the set up
  - feet under your hips
  - You want weight in the middle of your foot with your heel down 
  - You still want to be able to wiggle your toes if you had to
  - Shoulders just in front of the bar
  - Back and lats turned on with your shoulders active
    - think about putting your shoulder blades in your back pockets
  - Core tight!
  - Gaze ~4 feet ahead of you with a neutral neck
- As you initiate the movement you want your hips and shoulders to rise at the same time
- When the bar is above your knee, you'll bring your hips to the bar keeping the bar path straight 
### [[Back Squat]]
- In the set up
  - feet shoulder width apart slightly pointed out
  - elbows pulled back and down
  - neutral spine with gaze looking forward
  - Big belly with your core tight
  - weight mid-foot
- You'll initiate the movement with your hips going back and down
- Fight to keep your chest up
- As you descend, your knees will track over your toes
  - keep pushing them out!
- Finish the rep with your hip crease below your knees
## Progression (for deadlift)
- We'll work on some elevator drills and then the full movement

**Elevator Drills** 
- This drill we will have you working on your positions during the deadlift
- When I say knees -- you'll bring the bar to just above your knee making sure you're in the correct position
- When I say shins -- you'll bring the bar down to your starting position
- When I say hips -- you'll extend all the way to the end of the deadlift
- We will work through these positions a few times to warm you up

**Complete a set together**
- We had deadlifts in the warm up but we can do one more set to make sure y'all are ready for some weight
