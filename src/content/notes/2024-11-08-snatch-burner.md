5 sets
Power snatch + Hang squat snatch + overhead squat

For time:
21-15-9
Hang power snatch
Overhead squat
95/65lb

## Brief 4:15-4:20

Today we have two pieces. First a snatch complex followed by a quick metcon with some light weight.

For the snatch complex, we'll build in weight over the 5 sets. As I like to say with snatch sessions, we'll keep building if technique looks good but if we start to see sloppy reps we'll back off the weight a bit to clean up technique.

For the metcon we have hang power snatch and overhead squat. This weight should be something light were you are thinking of holding on to big sets. I'd recomment breaking the snatches up into 2-3 sets knowing you're going to hold on for you overhead squats. looking at times of 4-10 minutes.
