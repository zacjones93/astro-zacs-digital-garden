Notes from [[Brennan Dunn]]'s Segment With Surveys course.


Here are some [[Essential Questions]] around segmentation:

- who is on your list?
- what do they want from you?
- how do you go about turning who your audience is into segments that make sense?
- how do you actually get people segmented?
- how do you create better experiences with segments?

    - you're messaging can become niche so you're product(s) don't have to
    - personalized messaging scales
