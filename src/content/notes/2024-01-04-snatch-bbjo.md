## Brief

BCF Snatch & BBJO

Today’s Strength is all about being explosive and getting as big of a jump as possible so we’ll work some drills to prime for that. The other aspect I want people to focus on is your landing position, you have a lot of room before you get below parallel. If we’re comfortable catching just above parallel (and avoid the star fish) you’ll move more weight

The metcon is going to be about pacing, try to find a number in the first minute that you can hold on to for all 10 minutes, maybe even picking up the pace with an extra burpee per minute rounds 8-9-10. The snatch is supposed to be heavy, if Rx is too much for you I’d go 80% of the snatch you hit in the strength piece
