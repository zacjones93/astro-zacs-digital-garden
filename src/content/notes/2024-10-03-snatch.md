[[BCF class prep]] snatches

6x3 power snatch
rest as needed between sets
rest <:10 between reps
## Brief

Today we have a heavy day working the power snatch. Today is all about being explosive while maintaining good form over 3 reps in a set.

For snatch sessions, I want you to build in weight but if we start having sloppy reps we'll back off the weight a bit to clean up form.

## Warm up

3 rds
hot lap
10 russian kb swing
10 kb goblet squat
10 bootstrappers with arm raise

## Stretching
3 rds
5 PVC pass through
5 behind neck snatch grip press

get lower each round
