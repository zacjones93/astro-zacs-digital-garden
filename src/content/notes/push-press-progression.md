Below is documented a [[Push Press]] progression I would take people through aiming to use wording similar to what I would actually say.

## Intro and demo
Alright So we are doing the push press today and I'll just go ahead and show you what a few reps look like
- show 3 reps from the front
- show 3 reps from the side
That's the push press.

## Points of Performance
Let's break down the movement and go over the **points of performance**
  - You want your feet in your jumping stance which means right under your hips
      - if you walk in place and stop you'll find a good starting point for you
  - you want your weight evenly distributed on your foot, driving through your heels
  - the front rack should look the same for the press, push press, and push jerk
      - elbows just in front of the bar with a tight grip on the bar
      - hands just outside of shoulders
  - as you dip, you want to keep your chest upright and dip straight down with knees out
  - Make sure you hit extension before using your arms to press overhead
  - and lock out at the top

## Progression with Athletes

**strict press warm up**
  - Let's warm our shoulders up with a 5 strict press. As you do these reps think about a straight bar path and getting your head out of the way as you press
      - keep ribs down 
      - work on a straight bar path
      - get your head out of the way by moving your head back
          - give yourself the biggest double chin you can

**check everyones starting position & few reps of the dip** — slow
  - Now we're going to work on the dip portion of the push press. It's extremely important to hit these positions correctly because this is where the power is at
  - lets do 5 slow dips. Focus on keeping your chest upright, knees out, and keep your weight in your heels
  - This will not be the speed you will actually dip

**dip drive with no arms**
  - No we're going to introduce some speed into the dip. 
  - Do 5 reps with a controlled dip and explosive drive out of the bottom
  - focus on staying explosive and squeezing your butt. don't use your arms! 

**a few reps with resets**
  - Lets put the whole movement together, we’ll do 8 reps
  - Focus on driving your hips and squeezing your butt BEFORE you press with your arms
  - The power (and weight) comes largely from your hips
  - Lock out over head

**then string it together**
  - Now reset and we will do 8 reps strung together
  - focus on maintaining that up right torso 
  - now that you are cycling still focus on driving your hips and squeezing your butt before you press
